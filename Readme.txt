The CALab.zip contains CALab.exe and 7 folders that can be extracted to run on a Windows 10 or 11 desktop. This application demonstrates the functions described in the MIT Artifical Life article 'Self-Organization and Phase Transitions in Driven Cellular Automata'. Update as of 20 May 24: an improved version of the software that uses less system memory is available upon request, please contact Hank Rainwater at rainwater.hank@gmail.com and I'll set up a Goggle share site for download.
